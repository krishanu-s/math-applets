### README

This is a Typescript library for creating interactive math applets to be viewed in a browser or in a mobile/desktop application. It is heavily inspired by [manim](https://www.manim.community/). This is an ongoing personal project.

Demo scripts, as well as compiled Javascript code can be viewed in `dist/`. Source code can be viewed in `lib/`.
