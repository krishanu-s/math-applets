            This is a place where I'm experimenting with interactive animations
            and explanations of math ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
            The software used is written entirely by me, and can be viewed on
            <a href="https://github.com/krishanu-s/math-applets/tree/main/src"
                >Github</a
            >. It is heavily inspired by <a href="https://www.manim.community/">manim</a>: several of the class names and abstractions come directly from manim.
            The most significant difference is that this software is written in Typescript,
            which allows for user-interactive elements, while the Python-based manim is used for rendering videos.

        <h2>Tutorial</h2>
        <p>
            The process of writing mathematical software is itself an excellent
            way to learn mathematics. New mathematics arises as it's needed for
            the task at hand, which is a great filter function for what concepts
            are actually useful. Making the software work is a good test of
            whether you've ironed out all of the details correctly. Writing this
            software taught me a lot, even though I already have a math PhD and
            have been studying math my whole life!
        </p>
        <p>
            As such, I've written a <b>tutorial</b> for the animation software
            I've used below. You will build up the software yourself from
            scratch through a guided series of exercises. Assumed prerequisites
            are a pen and paper, an appetite for learning, and access to a
            computer and the internet if you wish to execute your code. I highly
            recommend the last step, because it will keep you honest.
        </p>
        <p>
            The software is implemented in Typescript, a superset of Javascript
            that adds static typing and other features. I chose Typescript
            because (1) it allowed me to put interactive features and easily put
            the code onto the web, and (2) I wanted to learn the language itself.
            But you could just as well pick another language, such as Python
            (see, e.g. <a href="https://www.manim.community/">manim</a>,
            which was an invaluable reference implementation for me and inspired many of
            the abstractions I used).
