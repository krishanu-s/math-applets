        Consider the following task. You have $n$ points $P_0, P_1, \ldots, P_n$
        in the plane. Your goal is to draw a <b>smooth</b> curve which begins at
        $P_0$ and ends at $P_n$, passing through all the points $P_1, P_2,
        \ldots, P_{n-1}$ in order. <b>Smooth</b> means that the curve has no
        sharp corners or cusps. How would you do it?
    </p>
    <p>
        TODO Make a scene with n draggable points, and a button which generates
        a Bezier curve passing through all the points.
    </p>
    <p>
        TODO: We already know how to connect two points with a line segment, so
        we can do a piecewise linear path, but this has kinks.
    </p>
    <p>
        QUESTION: What does "smooth" mean? At minimum, direction going into and
        out of each point must be the same. First derivative. IDEA: Put
        "control" points between each pair of points, and use quadratic Bezier
        curves to connect them. Define a quadratic Bezier curve.
