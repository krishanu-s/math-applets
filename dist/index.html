            This is a place where I'm experimenting with interactive animations
            and explanations of math ideas. The code for these animations is
            written almost entirely in Typescript, and can be viewed
            <a href="https://github.com/krishanu-s/math-applets/tree/main/src"
                >here</a
            >.

            <b><a href="./sunrise_scene.html">Sunlight equation</a>:</b> This
            page addresses the phenomenon of solar angle. I got inspired to
            create these visualizations while investigating the questions, "What
            is the optimal way to orient a solar panel? How would we estimate
            the energy absorption over a day, depending on the time of year?"

            <b><a href="./wavesim.html">Wave equation simulation</a>:</b> This
            page depicts some simulations of the 2-dimensional wave equation. I
            wrote this to help me visualize some phenomena in optics, such as
            refraction, and the reflective properties of conic sections.

            <b><a href="./random_walk.html">Random walk simulation</a>:</b> A
            random walk on a lattice of dimension 1 or 2 has probability 1 of
            eventually returning to its starting point, but on a lattice of
            dimension 3 or higher has a nonzero probability of never returning.
            Why? This page is about visualizing and proving this fact, its
            continuous analog (Brownian motion), and some related ideas.

            A simple simulation to show that a string suspended at two points
            and allowed to hang under the influence of gravity forms a shape
            identical to the graph of the hyperbolic cosine function.
