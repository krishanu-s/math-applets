            This page contains several demonstrations of the

                    math applets software library</a
                ></b
            >, which is used to make interactive mathematical visuals which
            embed directly into web or desktop environments. I see this as an
            enhancement to the traditional text-and-image-based nature of
            written mathematics. The software is very much a work-in-progress.
        </p>
        <p>
            The software is heavily inspired by
            <b><a href="https://www.manim.community/">manim</a></b
            >: in fact, several of the class names and abstractions come
            directly from manim. The most significant difference is that this
            library is designed for user-interactive web elements (hence written
            in Typescript), while manim is used for rendering videos. They are
            designed for different (but highly overlapping!) pedagogical
            purposes.

        <p>
            <b><a href="./wavesim.html">Wave equation</a>:</b> This page builds
            an intuition for the wave equation, and depicts some phenomena of
            the 2-dimensional wave equation, such as dipoles and interference
            patterns. I wrote this simulator to help me visualize the difference
            between the ray model and wave model of optics, and to visualize the
            reflective property of conic sections.

        <p>
            <b><a href="./random_walk.html">Random walks</a>:</b> A random walk
            on a lattice of dimension 1 or 2 will always return to its starting
            point. But a random walk on a lattice of dimension 3 or higher may
            never return. Why? This page is about visualizing and proving this
            theorem, and exploring its continuous analog (Brownian motion).
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><a href="./sunrise_scene.html">Sunrise equation</a>:</b>
            This page uses 3D geometry to visualize the calculation of sunrise
            and sunset times, among other things. I was inspired to write this
            page while thinking about how to calculate the energy absorbed by a
            solar panel over the course of a day.

            A simple simulation to show that a string suspended at two points
            and allowed to hang under the influence of gravity forms a shape
            identical to the graph of the hyperbolic cosine function.
