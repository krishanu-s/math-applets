        <p>
            This page contains several demonstrations of
            <b
                ><a
                    href="https://github.com/krishanu-s/math-applets/tree/main/src"
                >
                    math applets</a
                ></b
            >, which is used to make interactive mathematical visuals which can
            be embedded directly into web or desktop environments. I have used
            this on an ad-hoc basis to supplement math teaching, and hope to
            build more interactive applets as an enhancement to traditionally
            static written mathematics. This page is continuously growing.
        </p>
        <p>
            The software is heavily inspired by
            <b><a href="https://www.manim.community/">manim</a></b
            >. The most significant difference is that this library is designed
            for user-interactive web elements (hence written in Typescript),
            while manim is used for rendering videos. Several of the class names
            and abstractions I used come directly from manim, and I've tried to
            keep the interfaces mutually intelligible so that applets can be
            turned into videos and vice-versa.

        <h2>Explanation pages</h2>
        <p>
            These pages consist of several animations arranged in narrative
            fashion, along with written explanations, to explain mathematical
            ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><a href="./wavesim.html">Wave equation</a>:</b> This page builds
            an intuition for the wave equation, and depicts some phenomena of
            the 2-dimensional wave equation, such as dipoles and interference
            patterns. I wrote this simulator to help me visualize the difference
            between the ray model and wave model of optics, and to visualize the
            reflective property of conic sections.

        <p>
            <b><a href="./random_walk.html">Random walks</a>:</b> A random walk
            on a lattice of dimension 1 or 2 will always return to its starting
            point. But a random walk on a lattice of dimension 3 or higher may
            never return. Why? This page is about visualizing and proving this
            theorem.

        <h2>Demos</h2>
        <p>
            These are one-off applets I'm using for showcasing new features of
            the library.

            the ability to click-and-drag objects within a scene, and
            accordingly modify connected parts of the scene.

            <a href="./sunrise_scene.html">Sunrise equation</a>: This page uses
            3D geometry to visualize the calculation of sunrise and sunset
            times, among other things. I was inspired to write this page while
            thinking about how to calculate the energy absorbed by a solar panel
            over the course of a day.
