            This is a place where I'm experimenting with interactive animations
            and explanations of math ideas. The hope is that visuals you can interact
            with -- drag a slider, push a button, etc -- will help in initial learning.

            The code for these animations is  written almost entirely in Typescript, and can be viewed
            <a href="https://github.com/krishanu-s/math-applets/tree/main/src"
                >here</a
            >.

        <h2>Tutorial</h2>
        <p>
            The process of writing mathematical software is itself an excellent
            way to learn mathematics. New mathematics arises as it's needed for
            the task at hand, which is a great filter function for what concepts
            are actually useful. Making the software work is a good test of
            whether you've ironed out all of the details correctly. Writing this
            software taught me a lot, even though I already have a math PhD and
            have been studying math my whole life!
        </p>
        <p>
            As such, I've written a <b>tutorial</b> for the animation software
            I've used below. You will build up the software yourself from
            scratch through a guided series of exercises. Assumed prerequisites
            are a pen and paper, an appetite for learning, and access to a
            computer and the internet if you wish to execute your code. I highly
            recommend the last step, because it will keep you honest.
        </p>
        <p>
            The software is implemented in Typescript, a superset of Javascript
            that adds static typing and other features. I chose Typescript
            because (1) it allowed me to put interactive features and easily put
            the code onto the web, and (2) I wanted to learn the language itself.
            But you could just as well pick another language, such as Python
            (see, e.g. <a href="https://www.manim.community/">manim</a>,
            which was an invaluable reference implementation for me and inspired many of
            the abstractions I used).

            <b><a href="./sunrise_scene.html">Sunlight equation</a>:</b> This
            page addresses the phenomenon of solar angle. I got inspired to
            create these visualizations while investigating the questions, "What
            is the optimal way to orient a solar panel? How would we estimate
            the energy absorption over a day, depending on the time of year?"

            <b><a href="./wavesim.html">Wave equation simulation</a>:</b> This
            page depicts some simulations of the 2-dimensional wave equation. I
            wrote this to help me visualize some phenomena in optics, such as
            refraction, and the reflective properties of conic sections.

            <b><a href="./random_walk.html">Random walk simulation</a>:</b> A
            random walk on a lattice of dimension 1 or 2 has probability 1 of
            eventually returning to its starting point, but on a lattice of
            dimension 3 or higher has a nonzero probability of never returning.
            Why? This page is about visualizing and proving this fact, its
            continuous analog (Brownian motion), and some related ideas.

            A simple simulation to show that a string suspended at two points
