        <p>
            This is a place where I'm experimenting with interactive animations
            and explanations of math ideas, in applet form. The software used
            can be viewed on
            <a href="https://github.com/krishanu-s/math-applets/tree/main/src"
                >Github</a
            >. It is heavily inspired by
            <a href="https://www.manim.community/">manim</a>: several of the
            class names and abstractions come directly from manim. The most
            significant difference is that this library is designed for
            user-interactive web elements (hence written in Typescript), while
            manim is used for rendering videos.

        <p>
            <b><a href="./wavesim.html">Wave equation</a>:</b> This page builds
            an intuition for the wave equation, and depicts some phenomena of
            the 2-dimensional wave equation such as dipoles. I wrote this
            simulator to help me visualize the difference between the ray model
            and wave model of optics and to visualize the reflective property of
            conic sections.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><a href="./random_walk.html">Random walk simulation</a>:</b> A
            random walk on a lattice of dimension 1 or 2 has probability 1 of
            eventually returning to its starting point, but on a lattice of
            dimension 3 or higher has a nonzero probability of never returning.
            Why? This page is about visualizing and proving this fact and
            exploring its continuous analog (Brownian motion).

            <b><a href="./sunrise_scene.html">Sunrise equation</a>:</b>
            This page uses 3D geometry to visualize the calculation of sunrise
            and sunset times. I got inspired to create these visualizations
            while investigating the questions, "What is the optimal way to
            orient a solar panel? How would we estimate the energy absorption
            over a day, depending on the time of year?"

            A simple simulation to show that a string suspended at two points
            and allowed to hang under the influence of gravity forms a shape
            identical to the graph of the hyperbolic cosine function.
