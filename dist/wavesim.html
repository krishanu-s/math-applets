            <h1>Light, sound, and propagating waves</h1>
            <p>
                The <b>wave equation</b> is a partial differential equation that
                describes the propagation of waves through a medium, such as
                mechanical waves (such as sound) through air or water, or
                electromagnetic waves (such as visible light or radio waves)
                through vacuum or glass.
            </p>
            <p>
                The two-dimensional wave equation can be used to visualize waves
                propagating in a two-dimensional medium, such as ripples on the
                surface of water. Each point in the $xy$-plane has an associated
                real-numbered value, and this collection of values evolves
                through time. I've used a color map where
                <font color="red">red</font> indicates a positive value,
                <font color="blue">blue</font> indicates a negative value, and
                <font color="grey">white</font>
                indicates zero. The applet below simulates a
                <b>dipole</b>, where the wave equation has two point sources
                with opposite phase.

            <p>
                Let's make this more precise. In mathematical notation, the
                values of this heatmap can be represented by a function in three
                variables: the two spatial variables $x$ and $y$, and the time
                variable $t \ge 0$. We can denote this by $f(x, y, t)$. The wave
                equation is the partial differential equation which indicates
                how the function changes over time and space every inside the
                domain: $$\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\right)^2f =
                \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right)^2f +
                \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)^2f$$ One also needs
                <b>boundary conditions</b> to specify the values of the function
                at the boundary of the domain. One example of boundary
                conditions is to specify <b>point sources</b> $(x, y)$ where the
                function value varies sinusoidally, i.e. goes as $A\cos(\omega
                \cdot (t - \phi))$ for some amplitude $A$, frequency $\omega$,
                and phase $\phi$. Such points can be viewed as sources for
                propagating waves. In the example above, we have two point
                sources which are fully out-of-phase with each other (i.e. phase
                difference $\pi$).
            </p>
            <p>
                When a line of point sources with amplitude zero are placed,
                they act as a <b>reflector</b> for incoming waves. (TODO Make
                another demo)
            </p>

            <p>
                As mentioned in the opening paragraph, electromagnetic radiation
                (such as light) and sound propagate as <b>waves</b>. There is
                another familiar model we use for envisioning light, namely as
                <b>rays</b>. An often-quoted fact about ellipses is that
                multiple rays emanating at the same speed from one focus and
                reflecting off the ellipse will all simultaneously converge at
                the other focus. The analogous statement for a parabola is that
                multiply rays emanating at the same speed from the focus and
                reflecting off the parabola will then end up traveling parallel
                to the axis of symmetry, all lying on a line perpendicular to
                said axis.

                The question I want to investigate is:
                <b
                    >does this property of conic sections still hold when the
                    ray-model is replaced by the wave-model?</b
                >
            </p>
            <p>
                More generally,
                <b
                    >how much does qualitative intuition carry over between the
                    two models?</b
                >
                There are definitely behaviors which differ between the two
                models: for example, light and sound cannot bend around a corner
                in the ray model, but they can in the wave model. (TODO example)
                The
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment"
                    >double-slit experiment</a
                >, which demonstrates the existence of wave interference, is the
                prototypical example of qualitative behavior which is captured
                by the wave model and not by the ray model.

                First, let's decipher the differential equation above into plain
                English, by thinking from first principles.
            </p>
            <h2>Origin of the wave equation: vibrating springs</h2>

            <p>
                Example 0: A single vibrating spring. Force is proportional to
                displacement. TODO Add explanation and force arrows.

            <p>
                Now let's consider a sequence of point masses in a horizontal
                line, connected by springs. TODO Example 1: A sequence of point
                masses connected by springs. Let $x_i$ be the displacement of
                the $i$-th mass. Displacement can be either transversal, or
                longitudinal (show both examples). Think about force on each
                mass, and draw with arrows (which can be turned on or off).

                TODO Example 2: Go to the limit of an infinite number of point
                masses which are infinitely close, and see how we get a
                differential equation, which is the 1D wave equation (draw as a
                curve). Global behavior: 2a: If fixed at both ends, we get
                standing waves, and stable states are given by linear
                combinations of sine waves with discrete frequencies. 2b: If
                open (e.g. at one end) then stable states are again given by
                sine waves. Show examples of driven behavior.
