                This is a simulation of the <b>wave equation</b> in two
                dimensions. We use a color map where positive values appear in
                red, and negative values in blue.
            </p>
            <p>
                The value at each point $(x, y)$ at time $t$ is represented by a
                real number $u(x, y, t)$. The function $u(x, y, t)$ obeys the
                differential equation $$\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial
                t}\right)^2u = \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right)^2u +
                \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)^2u$$ at almost all
                points $(x, y)$. The points where this relationship is violated
                come in two flavors: (1) stationary points where the function
                value is held at 0 for all $t$, which act as reflective surfaces
                for waves, and (2) wave point sources where the function value
                goes as $A\cos(\omega t)$ for some amplitude $A$ and frequency
                $\omega$.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the simulation below, the reflective surface is chosen to be
                a conic section, and one focus is chosen as a point source.

                TODO Why am I investigating this? Conic section property
                (applet). Colloquially described in terms of light rays.
                However, light behaves like waves (applet?). Are the wave
                description and ray description the same? I don't think so:
                think of light bending around a corner (applet).

            <h2>Origin of the wave equation: vibrating springs</h2>
            <p>
                TODO Example 0: A single vibrating spring. Force is proportional
                to displacement.
            </p>
            <p>
                TODO Example 1: A sequence of point masses connected by springs.
                Let $x_i$ be the displacement of the $i$-th mass. Displacement
                can be either transversal, or longitudinal (show both examples).
                Think about force on each mass, and draw with arrows (which can
                be turned on or off).
            </p>
            <p>
                TODO Example 2: Go to the limit of an infinite number of point
                masses which are infinitely close, and see how we get a
                differential equation, which is the 1D wave equation (draw as a
                curve). Global behavior: 2a: If fixed at both ends, we get
                standing waves, and stable states are given by linear
                combinations of sine waves with discrete frequencies. 2b: If
                open (e.g. at one end) then stable states are again given by
                sine waves. Show examples of driven behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
                TODO Example 3: Extend example 1 to 2 dimensions. Lattice of
                point masses connected by springs. Again, depict the force
                diagram.
            </p>
            <h2>Refraction and reflection</h2>
            <p>
                TODO Go back to one of the original examples and make the spring
                stiffness interactively change-able. See that this determines
                propagation speed.
            </p>
            <p>
                TODO Show this in 2D with a change of materials and a plane
                wave.
            </p>
            <p>
                TODO Show that a boundary condition of 0 is effectively a
                reflective surface. First show in 1D, then in 2D.
            </p>
            <p>TODO Figure out what to depict after this?</p>
