                The <b>wave equation</b> is a partial differential equation that
                describes the propagation of waves, such as sound waves or
                electromagnetic waves. It is a fundamental equation in physics
                and engineering, and has many applications in fields such as
                acoustics, optics, and seismology.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the two-dimensional wave equation, each point in the
                $xy$-plane has an associated real-numbered value, and this
                collection of values evolves through time. I've used a color map
                where red indicates a positive value, blue indicates a negative
                value, and white indicates zero. The applet below simulates a
                <b>dipole</b>, where the wave equation has two point sources
                with opposite phase.

                Let's make this more precise. In mathematical notation, the
                values of this heatmap can be represented by a function in three
                variables: the two spatial variables $x$ and $y$, and the time
                variable $t \ge 0$. We can denote this by $f(x, y, t)$. The wave
                equation is the partial differential equation which indicates
                how the function changes over time and space every inside the
                domain: $$\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\right)^2f =
                \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right)^2f +
                \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)^2f$$ One also needs
                <b>boundary conditions</b> to specify the values of the function
                at the boundary of the domain. One example of boundary
                conditions is to specify <b>point sources</b> $(x, y)$ where the
                function value varies sinusoidally, i.e. goes as $A\cos(\omega
                (t + \phi))$ for some amplitude $A$, frequency $\omega$, and
                phase $\phi$. Such points can be viewed as sources for
                propagating waves. In the example above, we have two point
                sources which are fully out-of-phase with each other (i.e. phase
                difference $\pi$).
            </p>
            <p>
                When a line of point sources with amplitude zero are placed,
                they act as a <b>reflector</b> for incoming waves. (TODO Make
                another demo)
            </p>

            <p>
                As mentioned in the opening paragraph, electromagnetic radiation
                (such as light) and sound propagate as <b>waves</b>. There is
                another familiar model we use for envisioning light, namely as
                <b>rays</b>. An often-quoted fact about ellipses is that
                multiple rays emanating at the same speed from one focus and
                reflecting off the ellipse will all simultaneously converge at
                the other focus. The analogous statement for a parabola is that
                multiply rays emanating at the same speed from the focus and
                reflecting off the parabola will then end up traveling parallel
                to the axis of symmetry, all lying on a line perpendicular to
                said axis.

            <br />
            <p>
                Does this behavior hold when the ray-model is replaced by the
                wave-model? More generally,
                <b
                    >how much does qualitative intuition carry over between the
                    two models?</b
                >
                There are definitely behaviors which differ between the two
                models: for example, light and sound cannot bend around a corner
                in the ray model, but they can in the wave model. (TODO example)
                The
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment"
                    >double-slit experiment</a
                >, which demonstrates the existence of wave interference, is the
                prototypical example of qualitative behavior which is captured
                by the wave model and not by the ray model.

                Now let's consider a sequence of point masses in a horizontal
                line, connected by springs. TODO Example 1: A sequence of point
                masses connected by springs. Let $x_i$ be the displacement of
                the $i$-th mass. Displacement can be either transversal, or
                longitudinal (show both examples). Think about force on each
                mass, and draw with arrows (which can be turned on or off).

                masses which are infinitely close, and see how we get a
                differential equation, which is the 1D wave equation (draw as a
                curve). Global behavior: 2a: If fixed at both ends, we get
                standing waves, and stable states are given by linear
                combinations of sine waves with discrete frequencies. 2b: If
                open (e.g. at one end) then stable states are again given by
                sine waves. Show examples of driven behavior.
