                This is a simulation of the <b>wave equation</b> in two
                dimensions. We use a color map where positive values appear in
                red, and negative values in blue.
            </p>
            <p>
                The value at each point $(x, y)$ at time $t$ is represented by a
                real number $u(x, y, t)$. The function $u(x, y, t)$ obeys the
                differential equation $$\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial
                t}\right)^2u = \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right)^2u +
                \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)^2u$$ at almost all
                points $(x, y)$. The points where this relationship is violated
                come in two flavors: (1) stationary points where the function
                value is held at 0 for all $t$, which act as reflective surfaces
                for waves, and (2) wave point sources where the function value
                goes as $A\cos(\omega t)$ for some amplitude $A$ and frequency
                $\omega$.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the simulation below, the reflective surface is chosen to be
                a conic section, and one focus is chosen as a point source.

                TODO Why am I investigating this? Conic section property
                (applet). Colloquially described in terms of light rays.
                However, light behaves like waves (applet?). Are the wave
                description and ray description the same? I don't think so:
                think of light bending around a corner (applet).
            </p>

                TODO Where does the wave equation come from? Vibrating spring
                example (applets). Next, do a sequence of point masses connected
                by springs and fixed at ends (applet). Then in the limit,
                retrieve 1D wave equation, i.e. vibrating string (applet). The
                finite-difference describing the acceleration becomes a second
                derivative. Then go to 2 dimensions, i.e. a lattice of point
                masses connected by springs (applet).
