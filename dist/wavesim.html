            <h1>Light, sound, and propagating waves</h1>
            <h3>Simulating the wave equation</h3>
            <p>
                The <b>wave equation</b> is a partial differential equation that
                describes the propagation of waves through a medium, such as
                mechanical waves (such as sound) through air or water, or
                electromagnetic waves (such as visible light or radio waves)
                through vacuum or glass.
            </p>
            <p>
                The two-dimensional wave equation can be used to visualize waves
                propagating in a two-dimensional medium, such as ripples on the
                surface of water. Each point in the $xy$-plane has an associated
                real-numbered value, and this collection of values evolves
                through time. I've used a color map where
                <font color="red">red</font> indicates a positive value,
                <font color="blue">blue</font> indicates a negative value, and
                <font color="grey">white</font>
                indicates zero. The applet below simulates a
                <b>dipole</b>, where the wave equation has two point sources
                with opposite phase.
            </p>
            <div class="applet-container" id="twodim-dipole-demo"></div>
            <br />
            <div class="button" id="twodim-dipole-demo-pause-button"></div>
            <div class="button" id="twodim-dipole-demo-clear-button"></div>
            <br />
            <div class="slider" id="twodim-dipole-demo-slider-1"></div>
            <p>
                The behavior of the wave surface is determined by a set of
                <b>boundary conditions</b>, and the wave equation which governs
                its evolution over time. It's similar to how a pendulum's motion
                is fully determined by its initial position and velocity (the
                boundary conditions), and the pendulum's length, mass and
                strength of gravity (which determine the differential equation).
            </p>
            <p>
                We can make these two pieces more precise for the wave equation.
                The values of the heatmap can be represented by a function in
                three variables: the two spatial variables $x$ and $y$, and the
                time variable $t \ge 0$. We can denote this by $f(x, y, t)$. The
                wave equation is the partial differential equation which
                indicates how the function changes over time and space every
                inside the domain: $$\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\right)^2f
                = \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right)^2f +
                \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)^2f$$ Boundary
                conditions are locations in space and time where the function
                does not evolve according to the wave equation, but is forced to
                evolve some other way. One such example is to specify
                <b>point sources</b> $(x, y)$ where the function value varies
                sinusoidally, i.e. goes as $A\cos(\omega \cdot (t - \phi))$ for
                some amplitude $A$, frequency $\omega$, and phase $\phi$. Such
                points can be viewed as sources for propagating waves. For
                example, above we have two point sources which are fully
                out-of-phase with each other (i.e. phase difference $\pi$).
            </p>
            <!--<p>
                When a line of point sources with amplitude zero are specified,
                they act as a <b>reflector</b> for incoming waves. (TODO Make
                another demo)
            </p>-->
            <h3>Connection to light and sound</h3>
            <p>
                As mentioned in the opening paragraph, electromagnetic radiation
                (such as light) and sound propagate as <b>waves</b>. There is
                another familiar model we use for envisioning light, namely as
                <b>rays</b>. A wonderful fact about ellipses is as follows:
                <b
                    >if you shoot a ray out from one focus and it reflects off
                    the ellipse, it will converge on the other focus. Moreover,
                    the total distance traveled from one focus to the other is
                    independent of the initial angle of the ray.</b
                >
            </p>
            <p>
                The analogous statement for a parabola, whose second focus lies
                at infinity, is:
                <b
                    >multiply rays emanating at the same speed from the focus
                    and reflecting off the parabola will then end up traveling
                    parallel to the axis of symmetry, all lying on a line
                    perpendicular to said axis.</b
                >
                This is, for example, how flashlights work, by reflecting light
                from a point source off a parabolic reflector to convert it into
                a unidirectional beam. Taking the reverse problem, parabolic
                satellite dishes and directional microphones work by focusing a
                distant source of radiation onto a single point by reflecting it
                off a parabolic reflector.

                The question I want to investigate is:
                <b
                    >does this property of conic sections still hold when the
                    ray-model is replaced by the wave-model?</b
                >
            </p>
            <p>
                More generally,
                <b
                    >how much does qualitative intuition carry over between the
                    two models?</b
                >
                There are definitely behaviors which differ between the two
                models: for example, light and sound cannot bend around a corner
                in the ray model, but they can in the wave model. (TODO example)
                The
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment"
                    >double-slit experiment</a
                >, which demonstrates the existence of wave interference, is the
                prototypical example of qualitative behavior which is captured
                by the wave model and not by the ray model. I've read that when
                the wavelength is much smaller than any physical features, the
                ray model is a good approximation of the wave model -- this
                holds true for visible light at macroscopic scales, but does not
                hold for sound waves.
            </p>

                First, let's decipher the differential equation above into plain
                English, by thinking from first principles.

                Now let's consider a sequence of point masses in a horizontal
                line, connected by springs. TODO Example 1: A sequence of point
                masses connected by springs. Let $x_i$ be the displacement of
                the $i$-th mass. Displacement can be either transversal, or
                longitudinal (show both examples). Think about force on each
                mass, and draw with arrows (which can be turned on or off).

                standing waves, and stable states are given by linear
                combinations of sine waves with discrete frequencies. 2b: If
                open (e.g. at one end) then stable states are again given by
                sine waves. Show examples of driven behavior.
